### 🔧 Dockerfile
We use a multi-stage Dockerfile to support development and production builds from a single definition.

Dev stage: Runs npm run dev and supports live-reloading.

Prod stage: Builds and serves the production-optimized Next.js app using npm start.

### 🧪 Development Setup (with hot reload)
#### 1. Create .env.dev
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

#### 2. Run the container
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.dev up --build
#### 3. Access the app
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Changes to files will automatically reload the app.
